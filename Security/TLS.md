# TLS Deep Dive

###### The following article goes over the basic details of how TLS works.

#### SSL vs TLS

SSL/TLS are secure communication protocols that helps protect data that goes over the Internet. SSL and TLS create a secure, protected tunnel accross the Internet.

##### SSL

Secure Sockets Layer.  
Created by Netscape in 1994.

##### TLS

Transport Layer Security.  
SSL was handed to IETF in 1999 renaming the protocol to TLS.  

###### Note: These 2 terms are sometimes used interchangeably; however, they are not the exact same protocol, they are diffferent versions of the protocol. TLS was built based on SSL, providing improvements to the protocl and the name was changed when it was handed over to the IETF.

# TLS Deep Dive

###### The following article goes over the basic details of how TLS works.

#### SSL vs TLS

SSL/TLS are secure communication protocols that helps protect data that goes over the Internet. SSL and TLS create a secure, protected tunnel accross the Internet.

##### SSL

Craeted by Netscape in 1994.

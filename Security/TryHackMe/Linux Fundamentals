GREP Command

#allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.

grep ""

Operator "&"
#This operator allows us to execute commands in the background.

Operator "&&"
#This shell operator is a bit misleading in the sense of how familiar is to its partner "&". Unlike the "&" operator, we can use "&&" to make a list of commands to run for example command1 && command2. 
#However, it's worth noting that command2 will only run if command1 was successful.
